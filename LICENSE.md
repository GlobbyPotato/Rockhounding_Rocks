The Rockhounding project is made out of very little java knowledge, taking the chance to learn some more from it and with the sole purpose of having fun.

The code might be gross or inefficient, yet the mod represents concepts and ideas in the way I wanted to be put together.

Injections and helps, as well as dependencies have been credited as much as possible inside the project site at Curseforge, in classes or methods where they are found.

- Only the uploads on the project site at Curseforge will be considered genuine and supported.

- You can read the code or pick some lines from it, if anything can ever be useful to you.

- You can suggest ideas or additions for the mod if you think it's worth, as long as they meet the spirit of the project.

- You cannot republish or redistribute this project, or monetize from it.

- You cannot make custom forks or alter the mod into a different one than the original upload.
